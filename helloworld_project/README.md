This step is very important. It can be easy to get lost in a new technology without having specific tasks to focus on. At Prime, we created those tasks for you. Your next step is to create a list of small projects or exercises you could work on to further your knowledge on the selected technology. Focus on things that your selected technology is normally used for. Estimate how long you expect each of these projects or exercises to take. After finishing this, continue working on your code example and submit your assignment.
